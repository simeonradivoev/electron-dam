# Electron Digital Asset Manager (Electron DAM)
![](./assets/banner.png) 
## Project
A bundle based digital asset manager built on top of electron using React and typescript.
Based on the [Electron React Boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate)

I created this app because I got to a point where I had a ton of assets accumulated from asset packs, and I wanted a way to quickly view and manage those assets without having to import them into a game engine or fiddle around with them in the windows explorer.
